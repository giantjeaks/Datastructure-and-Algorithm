# Datastructure-and-Algorithm


Necessary Data structure for Beginners.


# Stack :books:
    - seems like a layer of books the fisrt one is in deepest and another stack on top.

- pop ->  Removes and returns the value at the end of the stack
- peek -> Returns the value at the end of the stack.
- push -> Put the velue on to the end of stack.



# Sets :gift:
    - Work like array with no duplicate members and no particular order.

- has(e) => (Bool)Check if the set has an e or not.  
- add(e) => (Bool)Add the e to set after check if already.
- remove(e) => (Bool) Remove the e from set.
- Size(e) => (int) Return a length of set. //In ES6 it's property to set size not a function.


-Union(otherSet) => (Array)Return the union of two set between this and otherSet.
-Intersection(otherSet) => (Array) Return the intersection of two set as a new set.
-Difference(otherSet) => (Array) Return the Difference between two set as a new set.
-Subset(otherSet) => (Bool) Return if the set is a subset of a different set.




# Queue and Priority Queue :necktie:
    - Similar to stack but do a first in first out.

- print => (Array) Print out a collection Queue
- enqueue => Push a element in to Queue
- dequeue => Pull off the 1st item of array
- front => (Element type) Return an element first index (just return not delete)
- size => (int) Return a size of queue.
- isEmpty => (Bool) Check if collection is empty.

# Priority Queue 
    - Same as Queue but we collect the prior the bigger is the first one.
